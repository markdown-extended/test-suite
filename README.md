MDE test-suite
==============

This package proposes a set of files to test the [MDE specification rules](http://aboutmde.org/).



### About spaces

The spaces between HTML tags in the HTML results of these tests MUST NOT matter when comparing them
with your parsers results. They are mostly added for readability.

### About IDs construction

For these tests, the *ID* attribute values are constructed using the *underscore* `_` as separator
and adding a random numeric value in case of duplicates.
